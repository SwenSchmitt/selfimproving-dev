This book is an attempt to bridge the gap between the *“I
can write code”* level and the *“I understand reified types”* level of
software development.

Basically, this is the intermediate developer’s book. Most content out
there is either for beginners (because that’s the largest audience),
*or* it seems to assume you’re a senior software engineer with 20 years
of experience (because, that’s the profile of the people who write these
books and articles). This book sits between those two extremes.

The name of the book, if you’re curious, is a nod towards
[self-organizing
maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map), [self-hosting
compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)),
[self-replicating
machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine),
[self-modifying
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code), and other cool
self-\* stuff.

I list my other projects over at [filiph.net](https://filiph.net).
