<!-- does this feel too much like a self-help book? maybe skip entirely? -->

I'm writing these words sitting on a bench in a park in sunny California. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but you have to understand where I'm coming from. 

I was born in communist Czechoslovakia. My hometown's claim to fame was tractor manufacturing. My elementary school had to install scaffolding around the entrance so that "the crumbling plasterwork doesn't fall on the kids". For the first 30 years of my life, California was just something exotic that they showed on TV, with palm trees and surfboards and David Hasselhoff in red shorts.

**Aside:** This sounds like I'm one of those types who say that "kids have it easy these days". Nothing could be farther from the truth. We'll get to that later in the book.

I have been very lucky in my life. And one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me was my interest in programming.

If you're reading this, chances are you're on the same boat.
