I'm writing this line on a bench in a park in sunny California. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but you have to understand where I'm coming from. 

I was born in communist Czechoslovakia. My hometown's claim to fame was tractor manufacturing, and the average Czech could afford only half of what the average American could. For the first 20 years of my life, I didn't see a single palm tree, and California was just something that they showed on the TV.

I have been very lucky in my life. And one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me was my interest in programming.

If you're reading this, chances are you're on the same boat.
