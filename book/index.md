<!-- Main graphic idea: a comic illustration of a person lifting weighs, with things like 'reified types' written on them. Maybe use a Czech comic artist?

<p class="switcher-line-1">You’ve taught yourself variables, classes, functions, objects.</p>

I'm writing this book in the open, mostly because I have no shame. The contents that are available here are <span class="highlight">unfinished and in dire need of editing</span>. Chapters are stringed together willy-nilly, in no particular order. It's a mess.

If you want a consistent, full experience, wait for the book to be finished. It'll still be here for free (but it will also have a printed and an ebook version). On the other hand, if you want to follow my work as if this was a blog, chapter after chapter, you can subscribe for email updates.
