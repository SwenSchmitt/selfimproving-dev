<!-- Main graphic idea: a comic illustration of a person lifting weighs, with things like 'reified types' written on them. Maybe use a Czech comic artist?

You've taught yourself variables, classes, functions, objects.

I'm writing this book in the open, mostly because I have no shame. The content that is available here is unfinished and in dire need of editing. Chapters are stringed together willy-nilly, in no particular order. It's a mess.

If you want a consistent, full experience, wait for the book to be finished. It'll still be here for free (but it will also have a printed and an ebook version). On the other hand, if you want to follow my work as if this was a blog, chapter after chapter, you can [subscribe for email updates](#mc_embed_signup).
