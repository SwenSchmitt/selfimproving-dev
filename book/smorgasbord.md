Remember, this book is under construction. 

Before we sort things into meaningful parts, they live in here. In other words, <span class="highlight">in this part of the of the book, you'll find various chapters in no particular order</span>. You can read them anyway, like you would read a blog where posts are ordered chronologically.

Just know that by the time this book is released, this "Smorgasbord" part will cease to exists, and the chapters will be divided and strung together into meaningful buckets.
