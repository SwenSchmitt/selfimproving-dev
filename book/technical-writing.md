Recently, a colleague asked me about writing technical articles.

I’ve written a bunch of articles.
[Some](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-google-builds-a-web-framework-5eeddd691dea)

got pretty popular.

Writing is almost never a solo work. How do you ensure that every
relevant member of your team reviews the content, without bogging you
down in endless reviews?

My process is below. All of this assumes you’re writing the article in
Google Docs (or similar collaborative software), and make it accessible
and editable by all your colleagues. This might be scary at first (most
people prefer writing completely solo and only sharing with others when
the work is almost done). But it’s the best way.

Figure out who the “early” stakeholders are
===========================================

Hopefully it's just 2-4 people, subject experts, not a full committee,
and not (yet) editors. (I highlight this because just this week I'm
releasing an article with *seven* reviewers, and it's a major pain.)

In your early stakeholders, you want a good mix of Those-Who-Know
(typically the software engineers behind the code) and
Those-Who-Can-Communicate (typically more senior people engineers, PMs,
DevRel).

Write a short “principles” section
==================================

It is there to set expectations for the reviewers. It’s not going to be
part of the article itself. 

This section addresses questions about the scope and the vision of the
content. 

Is this article meant for beginners? Is it meant to be a quick read? Is
it more of a guidepost? Are you using some framing device that might
need explaining? Are you knowingly avoiding a topic for some good
reason? What are the goals of the article? What do you expect people to
do after they read it?

You don’t need to answer all these questions for every article.

Write a rough outline
=====================

Just a bullet point list. What comes first, what comes next. What points
do you want to make?

Ask for outline LGTM
====================

Ask the early stakeholders to review and specifically ask for LGTM
(“Looks Good To Me”; basically, a rubber stamp). Set a deadline for
them. If someone is a little late, that's okay, but don't wait forever.
Once it’s past deadline, it’s fair to just say “sorry, too late”.

Start writing
=============

When you have an LGTM from everyone on the outline, start writing.

Actually, scratch that. If you have any free time at all, *at any point
during this process*, start writing parts of the article or even the
whole thing. You'll learn the most by actually writing. You can plan for
200 years and never really see all the little things that come up only
as you start putting words together into sentences and paragraphs.
Writing is hard. We all have a tendency to try and avoid it via planning
or postponing, but that's folly. Be prepared to delete anything you
write at this stage. Don't get emotionally attached to your writing
(just yet).

Finish the first draft
======================

It can be rough, with images missing, paragraphs with "TODO" items, etc

Do the same loop as before, with LGTMs. Maybe pick only a subset of the
reviewers, or a completely different group.

Iterate
=======

You can iterate the draft several times.

At some point, you'll have a final draft
========================================

The final draft is something that should be structurally very similar to
what you publish. You can invite more people to review. Especially
editors (tech writers). If someone asks for a major rewrite at this
stage, then a) you're in trouble, and b) you should have asked them for
review earlier, OR c) they're being a little silly and you can ignore
them. (This is why it's good to have good subject matter experts AND
good communications people in the early stakeholders group.)

At the final draft stage, your content has already been LGTM'd several
times by people, so basically you only need a stylistic LGTM from a
writer. But it's good to circulate the final draft more broadly — little
things always slip by unnoticed.

Congrats, you're ready to publish!
