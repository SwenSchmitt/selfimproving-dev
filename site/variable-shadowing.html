    <p>True to the <a href="https://selfimproving.dev/about/">nature</a> of this blog,
this is an article about an intermediate software engineering topic.
Nothing breathtaking if you&rsquo;re a senior developer, but hopefully useful
to some of the self-taught programmers out there.</p>
<p>Try to catch the bug in the following function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>
<span class="t">void</span> <span class="i">prepareDeliciousMeal</span>(<span class="t">Fridge</span> <span class="i">f</span>) {
  <span class="k">final</span> <span class="i">e</span> = <span class="i">f</span>.<span class="i">getEgg</span>();

  <span class="c">// ... more code ...</span>

  <span class="k">final</span> <span class="i">ingredients</span> = <span class="i">f</span>.<span class="i">everything</span>
      .<span class="i">where</span>((<span class="i">e</span>) =&gt; <span class="i">e</span>.<span class="i">goesWellWith</span>.<span class="i">contains</span>(<span class="i">e</span>.<span class="i">id</span>));
  <span class="i">cook</span>(<span class="i">ingredients</span>);
}
</pre></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid bug, but that only makes it more infuriating when you
finally catch it. The idea of the function is to prepare a meal by
taking an egg, and then all the ingredients in the fridge that go well
with it. But, because of the bug, we take all the ingredients that go
well with <em>themselves</em> (which is, presumably, everything). So, instead
of a delicious egg platter, you get a sad heap of food.</p>
<p>All that because we use the same <code>e</code> variable name for both the egg and
for each to the ingredients in the fridge. And we either don&rsquo;t realize
it&rsquo;s a problem, or we forget.</p>
<p>(Do you want examples that are less silly? Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing#Example">delivers</a> ---
in Lua, Python, Rust, C++, Java and JavaScript.)</p>
<p>If you think this could never happen to you, consider that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found a variable shadowing bug in my code <em>just today</em>.</li>
<li>Less than a week ago, someone fixed <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/57915963662663da67aa51b4f944c93678db74ce">a pretty major variable
shadowing
bug</a>
in OpenBSD (the UNIX distribution with emphasis on code quality).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#the-name" name="the-name"><small>8&#8202;.&#8202;0&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> The name</a></h3>
<p>The idea behind the name &ldquo;variable shadowing&rdquo; is pretty straightforward.
The outer scope variable (the egg, in our case) is in the <em>shadow</em> of
the inner scope variable (the element in the <code>where</code> closure, in our
case).</p>
<p><img src="images/variable-shadowing.jpg" alt="A drawing. You (the developer) on the left, pointing to the right. Two
variables are standing there, each holding a sign with the letter &lsquo;e&rsquo;.
The farther variable stands in the shadow of the closer
one." /></p>
<p>I see it as two people standing exactly in line, having the same
silhouette. You think you&rsquo;re pointing at your old friend (egg) but in
fact you&rsquo;re pointing at some new dude (element) that stands directly in
front of him.</p>
<h3><a href="#mitigation" name="mitigation"><small>8&#8202;.&#8202;0&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Mitigation</a></h3>
<p>If your language supports it, turn on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linter</a> that warns about
shadowing. Shadowing is easy to detect by automated tools like that.
You&rsquo;d think everyone would have that feature enabled.</p>
<p>But in reality, many people don&rsquo;t. There are at least 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people just don&rsquo;t know there are linters available for their
programming language.</li>
<li>Others find lints annoying and turn them off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be either of those people. Yes, configuring a static analysis tool
can take time. Yes, when a strict linter is enabled, sometimes it seems
like you&rsquo;re not programming, you&rsquo;re just appeasing a tool. <em>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m
sorry, Mr. Linter, I&rsquo;m going to fix all the two hundred little nits you
just found in my code. I&rsquo;ll get right on it, sir.&rdquo;</em> Ugh. Such busywork.</p>
<p>Well, that busywork can help you uncover nasty little bugs before you
even write them.</p>
<p>All that said, there are legitimate reasons to shadow identifiers. As
always, expect exceptions. Just be on the look out for variable
shadowing bugs. They&rsquo;re widespread and nasty.</p>
