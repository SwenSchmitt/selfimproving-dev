    <p>I&rsquo;m writing this on a bench in a park in sunny California. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but you have to understand where I&rsquo;m coming from. I was born in a city in communist Czechoslovakia which was most well known for manufacturing tractors. For the first 20 years of my life, I didn&rsquo;t see a single palm tree.</p>
