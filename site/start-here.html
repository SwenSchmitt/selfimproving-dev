    <p>I&rsquo;m writing this line on a bench in a park in sunny California. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but you have to understand where I&rsquo;m coming from. </p>
<p>I was born in communist Czechoslovakia. My hometown&rsquo;s claim to fame was tractor manufacturing, and the average Czech could afford only half of what the average American could. For the first 20 years of my life, I didn&rsquo;t see a single palm tree, and California was just something that they showed on the TV.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky in my life. And one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me was my interest in programming.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, chances are you&rsquo;re on the same boat.</p>
