        <h1>“Programming is Fun”</h1>
    </header>

    <p>They once asked a famous Czech mountaineer why he’s doing what he’s
doing. Why does he risk his life climbing huge, cold, barren rocks? His
reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unwrap that for a moment. Mountaineering, at that level, entails
the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking long distances in snow</li>
<li>Sleeping in a sleeping bag</li>
<li>Eating low amounts of food</li>
<li>Having difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Suffering frostbite</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this sound like fun?</p>
<p>Of course it doesn’t. But there are different meanings of “fun”, and one
of them is the feeling when you overcome a significant challenge in the
real world. It’s the “fun” of being in a life-threatening situation,
where all your decisions have real meaning, and any misstep can have
dire consequences.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s not the same meaning of “fun” as when I say “this
movie was fun”, or “it was fun talking to you”, or “let’s play a fun
videogame”.</p>
<h2><a href="#fun-in-programming" name="fun-in-programming"><small>4&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Fun in programming</a></h2>
<p>Software engineering doesn’t give you frostbite, thankfully. It’s not a
life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>But the thing about software development: it’s incredibly frustrating.
Once you’re trying to build — <em>and finish</em> — a real world software
project, you’ll encounter these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to solve hard algorithmic problems</li>
<li>Encountering frustrating faults in your tooling</li>
<li>Having to redo days of work from scratch</li>
<li>Trying (and often failing) to understand incredibly difficult
concepts on a regular basis</li>
<li>Reading long articles that turn out to be irrelevant to your problem</li>
<li>Debugging for hours, with an anti-climax solution (like finding a
typo)</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet, some people insist that programming is “fun”. I’m one of them.</p>
<h2><a href="#brace-yourself" name="brace-yourself"><small>4&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Brace yourself</a></h2>
<p>The trick is to accept that software engineering is frustrating. Yes, it
is. Nobody owes you an easy, frustration-free experience — especially
once you’re past the codelabs/experimentation stage, and into the real
world.</p>
<p>Here’s a scenario I’m seeing way too often (in and outside of
programming):</p>
<ol>
<li>Start doing something</li>
<li>Encounter a problem</li>
<li>Fail to solve the problem</li>
<li>Get angry at yourself</li>
<li>As a result of your state of mind, become less able to solve the
problem</li>
<li>Go back to #3, or quit.</li>
</ol>
<p>You see this a lot when people are using any kind of technology:
computers, phones, apps, appliances. And of course, you see it with
programming, too.</p>
<p>The only solution is to embrace the frustration. To embrace the
failures. To try and avoid being angry at yourself. Then, go back to
problem-solving. That single thing can separate you from a lot of
failing developers.</p>
<p>Just keep going, keep improving.</p>
<p>And at some point, someone will ask you why you’re doing what you’re
doing. Why are you sitting in front of the computer for hours on end,
biting your lip, staring at a screen full of gibberish? And you know
what you’ll tell them.</p>
